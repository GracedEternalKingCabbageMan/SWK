//! Sequentia mirrors Bitcoin's address space per network, so a single

//! `m/84'/{coin_type}'/0'` and reuse Bitcoin's bech32 HRP. The Bitcoin network is
//! HARDCODED here (not derived from the Elements `Network`, which maps Sequentia
//! to `Regtest` and would yield the wrong parent-chain params).
